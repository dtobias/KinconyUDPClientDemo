From broken:
	- ensure vircom is killed
	- power off relay controller
	- start vircom, wait for its window to open
	- power up the relay controller
	- click "Device" button on vircom
	- double click on the device that appears
	- load defaults
	- check that working mode = tcp server
	- change ip address to be the same as used in relay.exe
	- click Modify Setting
	- power down relay box wait 10 sec and power back up
	- run relay.exe
		click connect (relay tick boxes should all un-grey)
		run Scan
			You must see the controller respond to RELAY-SCAN_DEVICE-NOW
			with RELAY-SCAN_DEVICE-CHANNEL_32,OK and RELAY-TEST-NOW response must be
			HOST-TEST-START.  If this does not happen, try re-doing this procedure 			
			from scratch, it usually takes no more than twice to begin working again...
		test relays by ticking and unticking the boxes and see the LEDs go on and hearing the relays actuate.
	- kill relay.exe
	- in vircom, 
		open the device management box for the relay controller 
		change work mode to UDP, click Modify Setting.
	- Run KinconyUDPClient.exe, it will exercise the relays.
	----------  At this point I have proven there is nothing wrong with my UDP client.  
	----------- I can set, read back relay state, read back port state with no problem.	
	- Stop KinconyUDPClient.exe by holding the shift key for up to 30 seconds (until the relay cycle completes).

	- Now completely kill vircom *without* removing power from the Kincony relay controller:
		kill the device management box (click x in upper right hand corner)
		kill vircom main window (click x in upper right hand corner)
		kill vircom in system tray (right click on icon and select exit)

	- Run KinconyUDPClient.exe again
	----------  At this point I have proven that as long as we don't touch the power on the relay controller 
	----------- my Kincony Client will run without vircom present. (sanity check)

	- Run and kill my Kincony UDP client as many times as you like.  Use the shift to kill it or just click the x in the upper right corner.
	- My code always starts and runs.  So it's unlikely that the problem which will be demonstrated shortly is related to timing, etc. in my code.

	--------------------------------------- Here's where the problem is always seen ---------------------------------------------
	- now pull the power on the relay box and leave it out for 15 seconds
	- if my relay client was running when you pulled the power, kill it by clicking in the upper right hand corner, normal windows method of closing a window.
	- plug the power back in to the controller box.  

	- The expectation is that simply powering down will *not* be a problem and that the box will again work like before once it is powered up, remembering all operations settings.
		- But it does not work like this as we shall see...

	- Start my program.  It will either hang at the first command or it will exit on its own because the return string from the start up commands is incorrect.



	--------------------------------------- Conclusion ---------------------------------------------
	- You saw my program running under various circumstances.  
		- Start and stoped it several times with no errors.  
		- Started it with and without vircom running (not even in the tray) with no errors
	- Either there is something wrong with my code that is needed in order to get the relay controller started after a power up OR there is a bug in the FW code.
		- You can see by inspecting my program (which is so simple it will take you less than 10 minutes to do) that I already do the stated init
			RELAY-SCAN_DEVICE-NOW
			RELAY-TEST-NOW
			if something else is needed, please telll me.

		- IF this is a problem in the FW, where some setting does not survive a power cycle please fix it and let me install new FW.  I will test it for you.
		  	- Once this box is configured one time using vircom, I need to be able to power this box on and off as many time as I like WITHOUT vircom 
			  present without causing this kind of issue.
